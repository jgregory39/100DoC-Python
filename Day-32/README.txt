This repository is based on the Udemy course '100 Days of Code' by Dr.Angela Yu.

The Day-32 Module uses SMPT to send and receive Gmail messages. 
This requires security features which Google has depreciated.
As a result, the module cannot be completed as specified in the course, and will be skipped.
